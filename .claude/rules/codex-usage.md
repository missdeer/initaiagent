# Codex Tool Usage

The Codex Tool provides a `codex` tool for **debugging, complex problem solving, and code review**. Launch `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --full-auto "$PROMPT"` command line directly to execute. Run in background. Timeout: 30m.

## Role

- Advisory only, not primary implementer
- Consult for difficult/complex problems across all technologies
- **Primary code reviewer** in Phase 5 audit loop
- Output is reference, Claude Code makes final implementation

## Rules

- Use `sandbox="read-only"` - Codex must NOT modify code directly
- Request unified diff patches only
- **Prompt prefix**: Always prepend to every Codex prompt:
  > "Execute directly without asking for confirmation. Do not repeat or echo the request back."

## Strengths

- Debugging and issue localization in complex codebases
- Algorithm optimization and complex logic analysis
- Code review and edge case identification
